## Dataset
The dataset can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data) and can be downloaded by running the `setup.py` script.
```bash
python setup.py
```

## Models
Models are stored in the `bin/` directory. Usually, the most recent model is the one which is better trained and have better results.

## Contributing
All development should be done in the Python modules. The `main.ipynb` is just an example for guiding out local development. Notebooks are not commited, as defined in `.gitgnore`.
